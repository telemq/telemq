![TeleMQ - MQTT broker](./docs/telemq-logo-white.svg)

TeleMQ is an experimental MQTT broker implemented in Rust language. The broker implements [MQTT version 3.1.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html) specification.

## Build from the source code

In order to buil TeleMQ from the source code, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language installed on your computer. The most common way to do it is via Rustup - a toolchain for managing Rust environment.

The official installation guide can be found on https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install page.

Need more info about Rustup itself? Please follow the docs - https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/.

Once you have Rust installed, clone the TeleMQ repo into an appropriate folder on your filesystem.

```
git clone https://github.com/telemq/telemq.git <DESTINATION_FOLDER>
```

After that go to the destination folder `cd <DESTINATION_FOLDER>` (you should have `Cargo.toml` file in the folder where you navigated) and run a `build` command from Cargo.

> Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust communityâ€™s package registry. You can contribute to this book on GitHub.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

```
cargo build
```

This will producer a development build without any optimisations which might be necessary for the production. The binary file can is `<DESTINATION_FOLDER>/target/debug/telemq`.

In order to have a production-optimised binary, please, run the `build` command with the `--release` flag.

```
cargo build --release
```

Similarly to the dev build, the produced binary in `<DESTINATION_FOLDER>/target/release/telemq`.

Those binaries are statically linked and are self-sufficient, thus can be moved anywhere if needed.

## Run TeleMQ

Assuming, you either are in the same folder where you have `telemq` binary file or you have added this folder to your `$PATH`, you can ran it with a default config simply with following command:

```
telemq
```

TeleMQ being ran with a default config will open a plain TCP listener on `0.0.0.0:1883`, will allow to connect any client. And will allow those clients to subscribe and to publish to any topic name. Logs will be streamed to stdout, all logs starting from `INFO` level will be shown. Keep alive interval is **_120 secs_** - make sure your client sends at least one message (PUBLISH or PINGREQ) per this interval. Maximal number of connection is 10,000.

To see all options, run

```
telemq --help
```

To override the default behaviour, one can use a TeleMQ config file. Information about a configuration options can be found in [`telemq_config.md`](./docs/telemq_config.md).

## Run in Docker

TeleMQ Docker image is to be created.

## $SYS topics

$SYS topics are to be implemented.
